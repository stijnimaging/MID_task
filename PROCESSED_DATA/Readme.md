For each trial in the task:
- trial number (runlist)
- level []
- target duration (tgt.dur)
- total money gain (total)
- index number in logfile (index)
- duration of first delay after cue (delay)
- duration of second delay after target (delay2)
- onset of the fixation cross; start of the trial (fix1.onset)
- onset of the cue sharpe (cue.onset)
- reaction time to target (tgt.rt)
- shape representation; circle 1/2/3 lines, square 1/2/3 lines or triangle (shape)
- risk; positive for circle, negative for square and equal for triangle (risk)
- the RT in the first delay after cue onset (dly.RT)
- the RT in the second delay after cue onset (dly2.RT)
- onset of the first delay (dly.onset)
- onset of the target (tgt.onset)
- onset of the second delay (dly2.onset)
- feedback onset (fbk.onset)
- cell 73:20 holds the MRI start time to correct the onset timings for
